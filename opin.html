      For me these two weeks were the best weeks of my life. I descovered how many things I can do in a single day. At first I thought I was dreaming, because everything looks spectacular: the view from the airplane, the campus, the friendly host. Since I was a little girl I have dreamed about a place like this and my dream seems to become true. About the workshops, they were interesting. From writing my first line of HTML to styling with CSS and making it interactive with JavaScript, i was amazed. Seeing my code come to life on the screen is indescriable. I am so proud of how many things i could do. Then, the people I met here were so friendly. I made a lot of friends and improve my comunication skills. 
      I also like the frirst interaction with out teacher Martin. I was a little scared, but than I realised he was right about all the things he told about life. He makes me rethink all my life and taking serious all my work and future preparing.
